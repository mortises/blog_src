# Introduction
Amazon uses "working backwards" for thinking, identifying needs and discovering opportunities. 

We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it.  Working backwards is a process that can be applied to any specific product decision. It is definitely important that using working backwards, especially when developing new products or features.

Full working backwards documents include Press Rlease, FAQs and Visuals.

# Press Release Introduction
The press release describes what the product is and why customers be care about it. It is good to write press release before you start building product. Press release could make sure we are working on the right thing customers will care. It's a one-page narrative which forces us to refine the customer benefit, ensuring that product planned for release really matters to the customer.

To help you get started, answer five questions.
- who is the customer?
- what is the opportunity or what is customer problem?
- Customer benefit clear?
- How do you know what customer want?
- Can you visualize the customer experience?



# FAQs
The FAQs is where you get into the details. It's a tool to unpack assumptions.
